Overview Of the Project
Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised
learning with imbalanced data.

Key Activitys :

1. Data Collection
Acquire Data: Obtain credit card transaction datasets. These datasets typically include transaction details (e.g., transaction amount, timestamp, merchant ID) and labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and anonymize sensitive information as needed.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. This may involve imputing missing values or removing problematic records.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that could be useful for detecting fraud. For example:
Transaction Frequency: Number of transactions in a given time frame.
Transaction Amount: Amount relative to the user’s average transaction.
Time Features: Time of day or day of the week.
Merchant Information: Frequency of transactions with specific merchants.
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure uniformity, especially if using distance-based models.
Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical variables (e.g., merchant type) into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. Handling Imbalanced Data
Resampling Techniques:
Oversampling: Increase the number of fraudulent transactions in the training set using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Undersampling: Reduce the number of legitimate transactions to balance the dataset.
Algorithmic Approaches:
Cost-sensitive Learning: Modify the learning algorithm to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.
Ensemble Methods: Use ensemble techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting that can handle class imbalance better.

4. Model Selection
Anomaly Detection Techniques:
Isolation Forest: Detect anomalies by isolating observations.
One-Class SVM: Train a model on only the legitimate class and identify anomalies.
Autoencoders: Use neural networks to learn a compressed representation of legitimate transactions and detect anomalies based on reconstruction errors.
Supervised Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification problems.
Decision Trees/Random Forest: Useful for handling complex interactions between features.
Gradient Boosting Machines: Techniques like XGBoost or LightGBM can handle imbalanced data effectively.
Neural Networks: Use deep learning models to capture complex patterns in the data.

5. Model Training
Train-Test Split: Split data into training and testing sets. Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

6. Model Evaluation
Metrics for Imbalanced Data:
Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Metrics that focus on the performance of the minority class.
ROC-AUC Score: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Evaluation on Test Set: Assess model performance on a separate, unseen test dataset to evaluate generalization.
